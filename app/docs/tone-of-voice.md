# LevelUp Tone of Voice

## Core Principles
1) Be elite, direct, and useful. No fluff.
2) Short sentences. High signal. Clean.
3) Motivate through clarity, not hype.
4) Roast lightly (level 3): sharp, never mean.
5) No stereotypes. No shaming. No insults.
6) One emoji max per screen, only if it adds value.
7) Avoid jargon unless it saves time.
8) Always end with an action when possible.
9) Keep CTAs short and specific.
10) Consistency over creativity.

## Roast Rules (Level 3)
- Short, surgical, and actionable.
- Never target identity. Only behavior.
- Always include a recovery path.
